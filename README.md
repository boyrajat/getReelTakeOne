### Result:

In this application we utilized the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to implement a search for movie titles. Ultimately, getReel allows the user to keep a list of movies they want to watch. Once the movie is selected, a modal generates a brief description of the movie including; movie poster, genre, cast, director(s), year of release and ratings. We also utilized The Movie database API to add a trailer feature of the selected movie. The user has the option to keep the movie in the watchlist or mark the movie as “watched”.
